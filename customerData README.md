## Project title : Customer Data
## Project overview 
This is a project work for my conclusion of a 3 months data analysis bootcamp organised by 'Ladies in Tech Africa in conjunction with the Incubator Hub.

## Objectives 


The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine the distribution of customers across various regions.
- To identify the most popular subscription type among customers.
- To calculate the average duration of subscriptions.
- To assess total revenue generated by each subscription type.
- To identify the top regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.
- To compare the total number of active versus canceled subscriptions.

## Data Description 


The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: Geographical region of the customer (East, North, South, West).
- **SubscriptionType**: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- **SubscriptionStart**: Start date of the subscription.
- **SubscriptionEnd**: End date of the subscription.
- **Canceled**: indicating if the subscription was canceled (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated from the subscription.
### Data sources 
The data was provided by our facilitators.
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
  1)  For Data Cleaning
  2)  For Analysis and
  3)  Visualisation 
- SQl(Structured query language) for querying of data

- Most consistent customers.


  
### Data analysis 
This includes the codes used for the data analysis and DAX expressions used
 ~~~ SQL
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'FALSE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Active_Subscriptions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Canceled_Subscriptions
FROM [Project 2.1]

## Results

### 1. **Excel Analysis**



**Data Summary Using Pivot Tables and Bar Charts** 

Excel was used to perform data summarization, categorization, and visualization on customer subscription information. The key steps and insights derived are outlined below: 

### 1. **Pivot Table Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Organize and summarize the data by region, subscription type, and cancellation status.
   - **Key Insights:**
     - **Total Customers by Region:** 
     - **Most Popular Subscription Type:** Determined that the "Basic" subscription had the highest count.
   
    

### 2. **Data Visualization with Bar Charts**
   - **Method:** Created bar charts to visualize key metrics, including customer distribution by region, revenue by subscription type, and cancellations by region.
   - **Purpose:** The visualizations provided a clear and immediate understanding of the distribution and trends within the dataset, making it easier to spot high-performing regions and subscription types, as well as areas with higher cancellation rates.




### 2. **SQL Analysis**

### 1. Total Number of Customers per Region 

| Region | Total Customers |
|--------|------------------|
| East   | 5                |
| North  | 5                |
| South  | 5                |
| West   | 5                | 

*All regions have an equal number of customers, each with 5 customers.* 

### 2. Most Popular Subscription Type 

| Subscription Type | Number of Customers |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Standard          | 8,420            | 

*The standard subscription type is overwhelmingly the most popular among customers.* 

### 3. Average Subscription Duration 

- **Average Duration**: 164 days 

*On average, customers maintain their subscriptions for 164 days* 

### 4. Total Revenue by Subscription Type 

| Subscription Type | Total Revenue   |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Premium           | 16899064    |
| Standard          |   16864376   |
| Basic             | 33776735   | 

*The Basic subscription type generates the highest total revenue, followed by Premium and Standard.* 

### 5. Top 3 Regions by Cancellation 

| Region | Number of Cancellations |
|--------|-------------------------|
| North  | 5067                 |
| South  | 5064                 |
| West   | 5044                 | 

*North, South and West are the top three regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.* 

### 6. Total Number of Active and Canceled Subscriptions 

| Subscription Status | Total Subscriptions |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Active              | 59825             |
| Canceled            | 59825            | 

*There is an equal number of active and canceled subscriptions, each totaling 10,827.*


### 3. **Power BI Analysis**
Power BI was used to perform advanced data analysis and create interactive visualizations based on customer subscription data. 
Filtered data to rank regions by cancellation count, with South leading followed  by North and West 
     -Created a series of bar charts, to represent the analysis visually.
   - These visuals offered an interactive way to explore the data, enabling users to drill down by region, subscription type, and cancellation status for detailed insights. 

To get the number of people who cancelled their subscription,  I created a conditional column called Canceled COUNT ...

~~~ Cancelled TRUE =1 Else 0

## Conclusion 

The analysis reveals significant insights into customer behavior and revenue distribution:
- **Customer Distribution**: Customers are evenly distributed across all regions.
- **Subscription Popularity**: The Basic subscription type dominates in popularity and revenue generation.
- **Subscription Duration**: Customers typically stay subscribed for a year.
- **Revenue Insights**: While Basic subscriptions generate the highest revenue, Premium and Standard subscriptions also contribute substantially.
- **Cancellation Trends**: South, North, and West regions exhibit higher cancellation rates, indicating potential areas for improvement in customer retention strategies.
- **Subscription Status**: An equal number of active and canceled subscriptions suggest a balanced churn rate that may need addressing to enhance growth.




### Recommendations 

1. **Increase Focus on Popular Subscription Plans**
   - Since the "Basic" subscription is the most popular, consider enhancing the value or features offered with this plan. Promotional offers or discounts could also be introduced to encourage existing Basic plan users to upgrade to higher tiers, such as Standard or Premium, which offer higher revenue per customer. 

2. **Target Retention Efforts in High-Cancellation Regions**
   - With South, North, and West regions having the highest cancellation counts, targeted retention strategies should be implemented in these areas. This could include customer satisfaction surveys, loyalty programs, and personalized follow-ups to understand and address reasons for cancellation. 

3. **Monitor Active vs. Canceled Subscription Rates**
   - The equal split between active and canceled subscriptions is noteworthy and warrants continuous monitoring. Implement automated alerts to detect trends in cancellations, which can allow timely interventions to maintain or improve the active customer base. 

4. **Enhance Customer Experience Across Regions**
   - Since each region has a similar number of customers, deploying region-specific marketing campaigns and customer support could improve engagement. Tailored services or localized features might help address unique regional needs and encourage customer retention. 

5. **Leverage Subscription Duration Insights**
   - The average subscription duration of 164 days highlights the need for renewal strategies. Consider offering incentives.

6. **Analyze Revenue Potential by Subscription Type**
   - With Basic and Premium subscription types generating the highest revenues, further analysis should be conducted to identify ways of optimizing pricing or bundling for these plans. Engaging with these customer segments through exclusive offers or additional services could lead to increased revenue. 

### Final Note
Implementing these recommendations could enhance customer satisfaction, and potentially increase revenue streams. Monitoring the outcomes of these strategies in Power BI will help refine future business actions and maintain a data-driven approach to growth.
