## Project title : Customer Data
## Project overview 
This is a project work for my conclusion of a 3 months data analysis bootcamp organised by 'Ladies in Tech Africa in conjunction with Incubator hub.

This seeks to look into customer behaviour in terms of subscription, highlight subscription patterns and identify the most preferred subscription plans..

### Data sources 
The data was provided by our facilitators.
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
  1)  For Data Cleaning
  2)  For Analysis and
  3)  Visualisation 
- SQl(Structured query language) for querying of data 
- Github: For portfolio building 
- Microsoft Power Bi.

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - 1) Data loading and inspection
     2) Checking for missing variables
     3) Checking and removing duplicate datasets
     4) Changing data to the right data type where applicable.
     5) Data  Cleaning
### Exploratory Data analysis 
This involves exploring the data to answer important questions such as
- The most popular subscription 
- Subscription patterns
- Most consistent customers. 

### Data analysis 
This includes the codes used for the data analysis and DAX expressions used
 ~~~ SQL
select * from [Capstone project ]where order_id = 3
~~~
 
### Data Visualisation 
Data Visualisation tool Power Bi 

Using Power Bi I was able to first transform the data and checked out for any data inconsistencies using the column quality option. After that I proceeded to analyse my Data.

To get the number of people who cancelled their subscription,  I created a conditional column called COLUMN COUNT ...

~~~ Cancelled TRUE =1 Else 0
