## Project title : Customer Data
## Project overview 
This is a project work for my conclusion of a 3 months data analysis bootcamp organised by 'Ladies in Tech Africa in conjunction with Incubator hub.

## Objectives 

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine the distribution of customers across various regions.
- To identify the most popular subscription type among customers.
- To calculate the average duration of subscriptions.
- To assess total revenue generated by each subscription type.
- To identify the top regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.
- To compare the total number of active versus canceled subscriptions.
### Data sources 
The data was provided by our facilitators.
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
  1)  For Data Cleaning
  2)  For Analysis and
  3)  Visualisation 
- SQl(Structured query language) for querying of data 
- Github: For portfolio building 
- Microsoft Power Bi.

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - 1) Data loading and inspection
     2) Checking for missing variables
     3) Checking and removing duplicate datasets
     4) Changing data to the right data type where applicable.
     5) Data  Cleaning
### Exploratory Data analysis 
This involves exploring the data to answer important questions such as
- The most popular subscription 
- Subscription patterns
- Most consistent customers. 

### Data analysis 
This includes the codes used for the data analysis and DAX expressions used
 ~~~ SQL
select * from [Capstone project ]where order_id = 3
~~~
 
### Data Visualisation 
Data Visualisation tool Power Bi 

Using Power Bi I was able to first transform the data and checked out for any data inconsistencies using the column quality option. After that I proceeded to analyse my Data.

To get the number of people who cancelled their subscription,  I created a conditional column called COLUMN COUNT ... 
powerbi
~~~ Cancelled TRUE =1 Else 0
~~~

## Inference from the analysis 
People who cancelled their subscription were from the
- North
- South
- and West Region.

There was no cancellation from the East.

The subscription plan that had the most cancellation was - followed by - and
