## Project title : Customer Data
## Project overview 
This is a project work for my conclusion of a 3 months data analysis bootcamp organised by 'Ladies in Tech Africa in conjunction with the Incubator Hub.

## Objectives 

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine the distribution of customers across various regions.
- To identify the most popular subscription type among customers.
- To calculate the average duration of subscriptions.
- To assess total revenue generated by each subscription type.
- To identify the top regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.
- To compare the total number of active versus canceled subscriptions.

## Data Description 

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: Geographical region of the customer (East, North, South, West).
- **SubscriptionType**: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- **SubscriptionStart**: Start date of the subscription.
- **SubscriptionEnd**: End date of the subscription.
- **Canceled**: indicating if the subscription was canceled (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated from the subscription.
### Data sources 
The data was provided by our facilitators.
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
  1)  For Data Cleaning
  2)  For Analysis and
  3)  Visualisation 
- SQl(Structured query language) for querying of data 
- Github: For portfolio building 
- Microsoft Power Bi.

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - 1) Data loading and inspection
     2) Checking for missing variables
     3) Checking and removing duplicate datasets
     4) Changing data to the right data type where applicable.
     5) Data  Cleaning
### Exploratory Data analysis 
This involves exploring the data to answer important questions such as
- The most popular subscription 
- Subscription patterns
- Most consistent customers.
  

### Data analysis 
This includes the codes used for the data analysis and DAX expressions used
 ~~~ SQL
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'FALSE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Active_Subscriptions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Canceled_Subscriptions
FROM [Project 2.1]

## Results

### 1. **Excel Analysis**



**Data Summary Using Pivot Tables and Bar Charts** 

Excel was used to perform data summarization, categorization, and visualization on customer subscription information. The key steps and insights derived are outlined below: 

### 1. **Pivot Table Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Organize and summarize the data by region, subscription type, and cancellation status.
   - **Key Insights:**
     - **Total Customers by Region:** 
     - **Most Popular Subscription Type:** Determined that the "Basic" subscription had the highest count.
   
    

### 2. **Data Visualization with Bar Charts**
   - **Method:** Created bar charts to visualize key metrics, including customer distribution by region, revenue by subscription type, and cancellations by region.
   - **Purpose:** The visualizations provided a clear and immediate understanding of the distribution and trends within the dataset, making it easier to spot high-performing regions and subscription types, as well as areas with higher cancellation rates.




### 2. **SQL Analysis**

### 1. Total Number of Customers per Region 

| Region | Total Customers |
|--------|------------------|
| East   | 5                |
| North  | 5                |
| South  | 5                |
| West   | 5                | 

*All regions have an equal number of customers, each with 5 customers.* 

### 2. Most Popular Subscription Type 

| Subscription Type | Number of Customers |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Basic             | 9,816               | 

*The Basic subscription type is overwhelmingly the most popular among customers.* 

### 3. Average Subscription Duration 

- **Average Duration**: 365 days 

*On average, customers maintain their subscriptions for one year.* 

### 4. Total Revenue by Subscription Type 

| Subscription Type | Total Revenue   |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Premium           | $9,838,756      |
| Standard          | $9,794,756      |
| Basic             | $19,596,735     | 

*The Basic subscription type generates the highest total revenue, followed by Premium and Standard.* 

### 5. Top 3 Regions by Cancellation 

| Region | Number of Cancellations |
|--------|-------------------------|
| South  | 2,946                   |
| North  | 2,945                   |
| West   | 2,941                   | 

*South, North, and West are the top three regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.* 

### 6. Total Number of Active and Canceled Subscriptions 

| Subscription Status | Total Subscriptions |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Active              | 10,827              |
| Canceled            | 10,827              | 

*There is an equal number of active and canceled subscriptions, each totaling 10,827.*


### 3. **Power BI Analysis**
Power BI was used to perform advanced data analysis and create interactive visualizations based on customer subscription data. 
Filtered data to rank regions by cancellation count, with South leading followed  by North and West 
     -Created a series of bar charts, to represent the analysis visually.
   - These visuals offered an interactive way to explore the data, enabling users to drill down by region, subscription type, and cancellation status for detailed insights. 


To get the number of people who cancelled their subscription,  I created a conditional column called Canceled COUNT ...

~~~ Cancelled TRUE =1 Else 0

## Conclusion 

The analysis reveals significant insights into customer behavior and revenue distribution:
- **Customer Distribution**: Customers are evenly distributed across all regions.
- **Subscription Popularity**: The Basic subscription type dominates in popularity and revenue generation.
- **Subscription Duration**: Customers typically stay subscribed for a year.
- **Revenue Insights**: While Basic subscriptions generate the highest revenue, Premium and Standard subscriptions also contribute substantially.
- **Cancellation Trends**: South, North, and West regions exhibit higher cancellation rates, indicating potential areas for improvement in customer retention strategies.
- **Subscription Status**: An equal number of active and canceled subscriptions suggest a balanced churn rate that may need addressing to enhance growth.
