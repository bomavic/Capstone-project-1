## Project title : Customer Data
## Project overview 
This is a project work for my conclusion of a 3 months data analysis bootcamp organised by 'Ladies in Tech Africa in conjunction with the Incubator Hub.

## Objectives 

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine the distribution of customers across various regions.
- To identify the most popular subscription type among customers.
- To calculate the average duration of subscriptions.
- To assess total revenue generated by each subscription type.
- To identify the top regions with the highest number of subscription cancellations.
- To compare the total number of active versus canceled subscriptions.

## Data Description 

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: Geographical region of the customer (East, North, South, West).
- **SubscriptionType**: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- **SubscriptionStart**: Start date of the subscription.
- **SubscriptionEnd**: End date of the subscription.
- **Canceled**: indicating if the subscription was canceled (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated from the subscription.
### Data sources 
The data was provided by our facilitators.
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
  1)  For Data Cleaning
  2)  For Analysis and
  3)  Visualisation 
- SQl(Structured query language) for querying of data 
- Github: For portfolio building 
- Microsoft Power Bi.

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - 1) Data loading and inspection
     2) Checking for missing variables
     3) Checking and removing duplicate datasets
     4) Changing data to the right data type where applicable.
     5) Data  Cleaning
### Exploratory Data analysis 
This involves exploring the data to answer important questions such as
- The most popular subscription 
- Subscription patterns
- Most consistent customers. 

### Data analysis 
This includes the codes used for the data analysis and DAX expressions used
 ~~~ SQL
select * from [Capstone project ]where order_id = 3
~~~
 
### Data Visualisation 
Data Visualisation tool Power Bi 

Using Power Bi I was able to first transform the data and checked out for any data inconsistencies using the column quality option. After that I proceeded to analyse my Data.

To get the number of people who cancelled their subscription,  I created a conditional column called COLUMN COUNT ... 
powerbi
~~~ Cancelled TRUE =1 Else 0
~~~


## Conclusion 

The analysis reveals significant insights into customer behavior and revenue distribution:
- **Customer Distribution**: Customers are evenly distributed across all regions.
- **Subscription Popularity**: The Basic subscription type dominates in popularity and revenue generation.
- **Subscription Duration**: Customers typically stay subscribed for a year.
- **Revenue Insights**: While Basic subscriptions generate the highest revenue, Premium and Standard subscriptions also contribute substantially.
- **Cancellation Trends**: South, North, and West regions exhibit higher cancellation rates, indicating potential areas for improvement in customer retention strategies.
- **Subscription Status**: An equal number of active and canceled subscriptions suggest a balanced churn rate that may need addressing to enhance growth.
